### ALL RGB Image Generator with Streamlit

In the github repo: https://github.com/YushanWang9801/AllRGB
I create one ALLRGB image generator with python. The project will read in one
input image and output an ALLRGB image. 

This repo, on the other hand, I use streamlit to develop a simple web application
that allows user to upload and download ALL RGB images easily.

To see my app, please go see website for this:


This project is inspired by the original work done by Michael Fogleman.
